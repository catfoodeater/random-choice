# random-choice
this isn't important. i just use it to help decide on things.

## usage
_it will create a folder called "choices" if it doesn't exist, and will list all the files inside it_

enter the name of a file in the directory

if it exists it prints a random line from the file

## example choice file
```txt
option 1
option 2
option 3
etc..
```
